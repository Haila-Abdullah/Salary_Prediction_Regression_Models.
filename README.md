# Salary Prediction Using Regression Models

This project is part of the *Coursera: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression* course. The goal of this project is to predict salaries based on years of experience using different regression models. The project includes the use of Simple Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Polynomial Regression, along with performance evaluation and analysis.

## Project Objective:
- Build various regression models to predict salaries based on years of experience.
- Compare the models using performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R2 Score.
- Analyze the results and identify the best model for salary prediction based on the given data.

## Steps Implemented in the Project:
1. **Data Preparation:** Loading and cleaning the data, selecting the independent variable (Years of Experience) and the dependent variable (Salary).
2. **Data Splitting:** Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
3. **Model Building:** Training various models (Simple Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Polynomial).
4. **Model Evaluation:** Calculating performance metrics such as MSE and R2 Score for each model.
5. **Analysis and Results:** Analyzing the model results and selecting the best-performing model.

## Libraries Used:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

## Next Steps:
- Collect additional data or include other features such as industry, location, or education level to improve the model.
- Implement cross-validation to get a more robust measure of model performance.
- Fine-tune the models through hyperparameter optimization.
